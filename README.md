# MiniGPT

Building a mini GPT from scratch is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of natural language processing, deep learning, and substantial computational resources. However, I can provide you with a simplified Python example using the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. Note that this won't be a full implementation of GPT, but a simplified version.

First, you need to install the `transformers` library:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

Here's a simple code snippet to generate text using the GPT-2 model:

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"  # You can use other GPT-2 variants as well
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set the device (CPU or GPU)
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model.to(device)

# Generate text
prompt = "Once upon a time"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1, pad_token_id=50256)

for generated_sequence in output:
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_sequence, skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(generated_text)
```

This code uses the GPT-2 model to generate text based on a given prompt. You can adjust the `model_name`, `prompt`, and generation parameters to suit your needs.

As for the dataset to train a full GPT model, you would need a large corpus of text data and substantial computational resources to train it effectively. OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, for example, have been trained on vast datasets and require extensive hardware for training. If you're interested in training a GPT-like model from scratch, you would typically need a dataset of text that's at least several gigabytes in size, and you would also need access to powerful GPUs or TPUs for training, which is beyond the scope of a simple code example.
